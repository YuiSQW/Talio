## How to run it

## How to contribute to it
1. Clone the gitLab repository.
2. Add an issue of the feature or fix the bug you want to work on.
3. Include additional tests, to make sure everything works as expected.
4. Make sure the test suite is passing and that your code is well documented.
5. Open an MR to merge your code and its documentation. You can mark your MR as a draft to let others know you're still working on it.
6. Wait for at least 2 reviews. If you get verifications from 2 reviewers, you can merge the MR.
7. If you get comments or requests to change something, please do so. If you fixed the issues/comments, you can mark the comment as resolved.

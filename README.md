## Description of project
Talio, a planning application currently in progress, is designed for the Java platform. This application empowers users to effortlessly generate, categorize, and monitor their goals through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). On the client side, Talio utilizes the JavaFX framework and has been meticulously crafted and tested on JavaFX release 17. While it is compatible with later versions of JavaFX, we strongly advise users to employ the recommended version to mitigate potential warnings and, in extreme cases, prevent crashes. The server side of Talio is constructed on the robust Spring framework, ensuring a solid foundation for seamless functionality.
